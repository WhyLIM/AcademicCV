    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is unclear regarding the association between metabolomic state/genetic risk score(GRS) and brain volumes and how much of variance of brain volumes is attributable to metabolomic state or GRS. METHODS: Our analysis included 8635 participants (52.5% females) aged 40-70 years at baseline from the UK Biobank. Metabolomic profiles were assessed using nuclear magnetic resonance at baseline (between 2006 and 2010). Brain volumes were measured using magnetic resonance imaging between 2014 and 2019. Machine learning was used to generate metabolomic state and GRS for each of 21 brain phenotypes. RESULTS: Individuals in the top 20% of metabolomic state had 2.4-35.7% larger volumes of 21 individual brain phenotypes compared to those in the bottom 20% while the corresponding number for GRS ranged from 1.5 to 32.8%. The proportion of variance of brain volumes (R [2]) explained by the corresponding metabolomic state ranged from 2.2 to 19.4%, and the corresponding number for GRS ranged from 0.8 to 8.7%. Metabolomic state provided no or minimal additional prediction values of brain volumes to age and sex while GRS provided moderate additional prediction values (ranging from 0.8 to 8.8%). No significant interplay between metabolomic state and GRS was observed, but the association between metabolomic state and some regional brain volumes was stronger in men or younger individuals. Individual metabolomic profiles including lipids and fatty acids were strong predictors of brain volumes. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, metabolomic state is strongly associated with multiple brain volumes but provides minimal additional prediction value of brain volumes to age + sex. Although GRS is a weaker contributor to brain volumes than metabolomic state, it provides moderate additional prediction value of brain volumes to age + sex. Our findings suggest metabolomic state and GRS are important predictors for multiple brain phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy and the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. However, the early detection of glaucoma remains challenging, as chronic forms of glaucoma remain largely asymptomatic until considerable irreversible visual field deficits have ensued. Thus, biomarkers that facilitate early diagnosis and treatment for glaucoma patients with a high risk of progression are pressing. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Human disease-biomarker interactions network and human disease-target-drug interactions network were first constructed based on multiomics data. The greedy search algorithm was used to search for the hub biomarkers and drug targets for glaucoma. Genome-wide association studies and epidemiological data from the UK Biobank were used to verify our results. Biological network and functional analysis was conducted to find common network features and pathways. RESULTS: We identified 10 hub biomarkers/drug targets for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis for glaucoma. These results were verified by text mining and genomic/epidemiology data. We also predicted the new application of BMP1 and MMP9 to diagnose glaucoma and confirm the theory of hub biomarkers with multiple clinical applications. Further, relevant pivotal pathways for these hub biomolecules were discovered, which may serve as foundations for future biomarker and drug target prediction for glaucoma. CONCLUSION: We have used a network-based approach to identify hub diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for glaucoma and detected relationships between glaucoma and associated diseases. Several hub biomarkers were identified and verified, which may play more important roles in the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has emerged as the most prevalent and complex neurodegenerative disorder among the elderly population. However, the genetic comorbidity etiology for AD remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted pleiotropic analysis for 41 AD phenotypic comorbidities, identifying ten genetic comorbidities with 16 pleiotropy genes associated with AD. Through biological functional and network analysis, we elucidated the molecular and functional landscape of AD genetic comorbidities. Furthermore, leveraging the pleiotropic genes and reported biomarkers for AD genetic comorbidities, we identified 50 potential biomarkers for AD diagnosis. Our findings deepen the understanding of the occurrence of AD genetic comorbidities and provide new insights for the search for AD diagnostic markers.",

    "abstract": "The comorbidity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has been established in clinical and genetic studies. There is growing interest in determining the shared environmental factors associated with both conditions. Recent advancements in record linkage techniques enable us to identify the contributing factors to AD and AMD from a wide range of variables. As such, we first constructed a knowledge graph based on the literature, which included all statistically significant risk factors for AD and AMD. An environment-wide association study (EWAS) was conducted to assess the contribution of various environmental factors to the comorbidity of AD and AMD based on the UK biobank. Based on the conditional Q-Q plots and Bayesian algorithm, several shared environmental factors were identified, which could be categorized into the domains of health condition, biological sample parameters, body index, and attendance availability. Finally, we generated a shared etiology landscape for AD and AMD by combining existing knowledge with our novel findings.",

    "abstract": "The rapidly evolving landscape of biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC) necessitates an integrative, updated repository. In response, we constructed the Colorectal Cancer Biomarker Database (CBD), which collected and displayed the curated biomedicine information for 870 CRC biomarkers in the previous study. Building on CBD, we have now developed CBD2, which includes information on 1569 newly reported biomarkers derived from different biological sources (DNA, RNA, protein, and others) and clinical applications (diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis). CBD2 also incorporates information on nonbiomarkers that have been identified as unsuitable for use as biomarkers in CRC. A key new feature of CBD2 is its network analysis function, by which users can investigate the visible and topological network between biomarkers and identify their relevant pathways. CBD2 also allows users to query a series of chemicals, drug combinations, or multiple targets, to enable multidrug, multitarget, multipathway analyses, toward facilitating the design of polypharmacological treatments for CRC. CBD2 is freely available at http://www.eyeseeworld.com/cbd.",
